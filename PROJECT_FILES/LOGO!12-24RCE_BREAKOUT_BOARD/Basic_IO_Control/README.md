## ðŸ“Œ Overview

This project is designed to be used to test the various Digital & Anaglog Inputs as well as Digital Outputs of the TVET Systems LOGO! Breakout-Board. It is out-of-scope for students but this project needs to be understood by the lecturer to make sure the board is functioning properly.

This project can also serve as a template that can be modified for other projects.

### **Mode Selection**
The TDE Display F-Keys are used to select 'testing modes'.
- F1 â†’ Home Screen
- F2 â†’ Digital I/O Screen
    - C-Key Right â†’ Next
    - C-Key Left  â†’ Back
    - While in the Digital I/O testing mode, the outputs cannot be affected by the Analog inputs.
- F3 â†’ Analog I/O Screen
    - While in the Analog I/O testing mode, the outputs cannot be affected by the Digital inputs.

*Note: for the C-keys to be used as PB inputs, the ESC key **MUST** be pressed **WHILE** pressing a C-key.*
