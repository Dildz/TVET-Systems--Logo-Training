## üìå Overview

An automated irrigation system that controls three separate irrigation valves for different plant types in a greenhouse environment. Includes water level monitoring for aquatic plants and time-based irrigation schedules for other plant types.

Useful for:
- **Greenhouse Operations:** Automated irrigation for different plant species with varying water requirements
- **Aquatic Plant Maintenance:** Precise water level control for pond environments
- **Energy Efficiency:** Scheduled watering during optimal times

## üíß Irrigation Schedule

### Water Pump (Q1)
- **Control Method:** 2-position switch
- **Activation:** Pump turns ON when switch (I1) is in the ON postion

### Type 1 Plants (Aquatic) - Irrigation Valve 1 (Q2)
- **Control Method:** Water level monitoring via ultrasonic sensor
- **Activation:** Valve OPENS when level is between 0 & 800, CLOSES when level = 1000
- **Conditions:** System enabled (I1 ON) AND water level outside acceptable range

### Type 2 Plants - Irrigation Valve 2 (Q3)
- **Schedule:** Daily at 06:00-06:03 AM and 20:00-20:03
- **Duration:** 3 minutes per irrigation cycle
- **Conditions:** Valve OPENS if system enabled (I1 ON) AND weekly timer active

### Type 3 Plants - Irrigation Valve 3 (Q4)
- **Schedule:** Evening irrigation triggered by photosensitive switch
- **Duration:** 2 minutes after photosensitive switch turns OFF
- **Conditions:** Valve OPENS if system enabled (I1 ON) AND photosensitive switch (I2) OFF

## ‚úîÔ∏è Advantages

- **Precise Water Level Control:** Maintains optimal water levels for aquatic plants with adjustable thresholds
- **Flexible Scheduling:** Easy modification of irrigation times through timer blocks
- **Energy Efficient:** Water pump only operates when needed
- **Light-Activated Irrigation:** Type 3 plants irrigate based on natural light conditions
- **Scalable Design:** Control program can be expanded for additional plant types
- **Fail-Safe Operation:** Requires manual system enable AND specific conditions to operate

## üõ†Ô∏è Notes

- Circuit is designed using **Siemens LOGO! Soft Comfort** software.
- Ultrasonic sensor provides 0-10V analog signal proportional to water level
- Photosensitive switch turns OFF at evening threshold
- System uses LOGO! 230RC controller with relay outputs
- Water pump (Q1) is enabled whenever the system is active and any irrigation valve requires water
- All timing parameters can be easily adjusted through block parameters
